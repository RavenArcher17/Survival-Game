# Changelog

## 2026-10-23: the island (M3 step 2)

- **Layout approved** (`Docs/terrain/LAYOUT_PROPOSAL.md`): island, hard-wall ridge, two passes, Vulkarn in the crater, Skaldrith on the glacier bowl, one water + one lava river on the volcanic side, middle spawns moved toward the passes, ~10 km² for the first playtest.
- **`L_Island`**: the full 4 × 4 km landscape (4033 × 4033 samples at 1 m, Z range ±1 km) as a World Partition landscape in 256 streaming pieces. It's now the default map for `play.ps1`, the server and the editor.
  - Built by `Tools/terrain/build_island.ps1`: Node exports the heightmap, then the editor (a window opens and closes by itself) imports it through `UWREditorTerrainLibrary`, waits for the landscape's GPU layer update, and saves.
  - Placeholder auto-material: dark ash west, snow east, rock on steep slopes. Sea plane, sky and lighting.
  - From the layout data: 6 spawns (biome-tagged), fire/frost altars at the two boss sites, 6 creature packs by zone, 124 resource nodes (wood/stone/copper everywhere, sulfur west, lichen east).
- **Walk test** (`Tools/terrain/walktest.ps1`), with real character movement: north-west spawn → north pass in 3.6 min, then onward to the tundra (5.9 min total). Middle spawn → north pass in 5.6 min, fording the river. Walking at the ridge mid-island gets stuck, so the wall holds.
- Fixed: rivers were 22 m deep trenches that trapped players; now 6 m deep, fordable, with gentle banks.
- Dev commands: `WRTeleport x y`, `WRLook yaw pitch`, `WRWalkTo x y`. `play.ps1` takes `-Map island|arena|grid -Path fire|frost -Name You`.
- Known: placeholder material only (no textures); rock barely shows on the ridge; a sawtooth shadow artifact on the steep ridge face at distance; no PCG foliage yet.

## 2026-10-22: M1 combat core + M2 paths (autonomous build session)

### Combat (M1)
- **GAS** set up: ability system on the PlayerState for survivors (survives death), on the pawn for creatures. One replicated attribute set: health, stamina, poise, hunger, thirst, Heat, Chill, burn/frost buildup.
- **One damage pipeline** (`UWRCombatLibrary::ApplyHit`, server only) used by every source: block (front 70°, stamina cost 10–25 by hit size, guard break at 0 stamina), parry (first 0.2 s of a block, staggers the attacker), dodge i-frames, poise → stagger → riposte (×3), Heat damage bonus (up to +30%), frostbite (+15% damage taken), Permafrost (+15% vs slowed).
- **Statuses:** Burn (DOT), Frostbite + Slowed, Frozen (frostbite on an already slowed target), Shatter (heavy hit on frozen; spends all your Chill for up to double the burst), Stagger. Replicated as gameplay tags; bodies tint by status.
- **Abilities:** light attack, heavy attack, dodge roll (root motion), block/parry (hold), Fire bolt, Frost shard, Flame slash, Ice slash, creature bite. Stamina costs and timings from the Starting numbers tab.
- **Combos:** Thaw (25/25: fire on a frozen target bursts and thaws it) and Balance (50/50: Heat and Chill feed each other).
- **Netcode:** attack/block slowdowns and sprint are predicted movement flags (no rubber-banding); hits are confirmed by the server.

### Paths (M2)
- Fire and Frost trees generated from the design doc (`Tools/data/extract_trees.mjs` → `Data/paths/*.json`).
- XP curve (point n costs 100 + 10n), 150 total / 100 per path, trunk-first, branch gates by points spent, root passive on the main path only, quick slots (8, auto-filled), character level = points ÷ 3 driving health/stamina (exactly 250/150 at 50).
- Main path from the join URL until there's a creation screen; spawn in its biome. **Boss altars** (E to interact) take/swap the subclass; progress is kept per path.
- **Persistence v1:** JSON per player in `Saved/ServerDB/players/`, autosave every 10 s, on logout and shutdown.

### Creatures & world
- `Data/creatures.json` (dummy, Cinderfang, Gloomhowl, Rimeclaw, Magmaw); stats from the zone tier's starting numbers.
- Training dummy (never dies, resets), pack-hunter AI (flanking, leash, give-up), creature spawner.
- `L_CombatArena` test map (dummies, both packs, both altars, biome-tagged spawns).

### Tools & tests
- `Tools/test.ps1`: 6 automation suites: XP curve, character level, tree shape, buy rules/caps, damage math, and a 12-step deterministic combat scenario in a real world. All pass.
- `Tools/mptest.ps1`: dedicated server + scripted bot clients (PvE/PvP), summarises hits/statuses/abilities/corrections from the logs.
- `Tools/persisttest.ps1`: build a character, restart the server, rejoin, check it's intact.
- `Tools/shots.ps1`: rendered client takes screenshots from both camera views.
- Dev commands (console / `-wrbotcmds`): `WRGivePoints`, `WRAutoSpend`, `WRBuy`, `WRSetMain`, `WRSetSub`, `WRWeapon`, `WRSpawn`, `WRStatus`, `WRHeal`, `WRKillMe`, `WRStarve`, `WRGoToAltar`, `WRInteract`, `WRView`, `WRBotPause`, `WR.ReloadTuning`.

### Stat nodes
- 13 stat nodes now do something (data-driven via `nodeEffects` in tuning): ignite chance, searing heat, long burn, crushing blast, heated blade, bellows, tempered, frostbite, deep freeze, hard break, keen edge (crits), light step, chilling touch. Ability nodes past the trunk (Fire wall, Meteor, Ice lance...) are still to build.

### Inventory (M5 start)
- 30-slot inventory on the PlayerState (server-authoritative, owner-replicated), items from `Data/items.json`, stacking + weight, starting kit (3 minor healing potions, 2 cooked meat, 2 waterskins).
- **Q** drinks a potion (healing only from potions, 6 s belt cooldown), **Z** eats, **X** drinks. HUD belt line shows counts, cooldown and carry weight. Inventory saves with the player.
- Dev command `WRGive <item> <count>`.
- **Gathering:** resource nodes (`AWRResourceNode`: wood, stone, copper ore, sulfur crystal, lichen). Melee swings harvest them (heavy = double), nodes deplete and respawn. Arena has 8 nodes. Test bot mode `-wrbotgather`.

### Terrain (M3 step 1)
- Landmass proposal for sign-off: `Docs/terrain/LAYOUT_PROPOSAL.md` (island, meandering ridge, two verified passes, volcano + glacier boss sites, rivers, spawns, walk times). Nothing imported yet.

### Known gaps
- Placeholder art only (no downloads this session): greybox bodies, no animations.
- Stat/ability nodes beyond the four trunk abilities and the capacity nodes are tracked and buyable but have no gameplay effect yet.
- No lag compensation for melee yet; ~0.3 small movement corrections/s per client in bot tests, likely pawn-on-pawn collisions.
- Save key is the player name (`?WRName=`); real account ids come with EOS/Steam (M7).
